## Description
- Notes app in JS created as a web app. Users can __add__, __edit__ and __remove__ notes.
- List of notes is displayed in a form of table. The columns are __time of creation__, __note content__, __note category__. Categories are predefined: “Task”, “Random Thought”, “Idea”, “Quote”.
- Notes in the table also display a __list of dates__ mentioned in this note as a separate column. For example, for a note “I’m gonna have a dentist appointment on the 03-05-2023, I moved it from 05-05-2023” the dates column is “03-05-2023, 05-05-2023”.
- Users can __archive__ notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.
- There is also a summary table which counts notes by categories: separately for __active__ and __archived__. The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.
